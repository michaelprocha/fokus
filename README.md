# fokus

This website is a task management application with an integrated focus timer, designed to help users stay productive while completing their tasks. It includes a 25-minute focus mode to work with full concentration, as well as short breaks (5 minutes) and long breaks (15 minutes) to rest between sessions. There are no limits on how many times each mode can be used, allowing users to switch freely between focus and break modes.
The timer can be started, paused, and resumed in any mode, giving full control over the workflow. Additionally, the site provides optional sound playback, which users can turn on or off directly within the application to enhance focus or relaxation.
